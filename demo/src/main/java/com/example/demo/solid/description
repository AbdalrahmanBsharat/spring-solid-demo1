SRP — Single Responsibility

Idea: a class should have one reason to change.
The example: we split invoice work into:

InvoiceCalculator (totals only)

InvoicePrinter (format text only)

InMemoryInvoiceRepository (persistence only)
SrpController composes them.
Run: GET /solid/srp/demo → JSON with id, total, and a printed invoice string.
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OCP — Open/Closed

Idea: open for extension, closed for modification.
The example: a DiscountPolicy interface with implementations (NoDiscount, SeasonalDiscount, LoyaltyDiscount). CheckoutService uses a map of policies; add a new discount by adding a class—no service changes.
Run:

GET /solid/ocp/pay?amount=100

GET /solid/ocp/pay?amount=100&policy=seasonal

GET /solid/ocp/pay?amount=100&policy=loyalty
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LSP — Liskov Substitution

Idea: subtypes must be usable wherever the base type is expected.
The example: Shape interface with Rectangle, Square, Circle each implementing area(). LspController treats them uniformly as Shape.
Run: GET /solid/lsp/areas → list of shapes with computed areas.
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ISP — Interface Segregation

Idea: prefer many small, client-specific interfaces over one fat one.
The example: PrintDevice and ScanDevice are separate. SimplePrinter implements only print; MultiFunctionMachine implements both. IspController depends on the narrow interfaces it needs.
Run:

GET /solid/isp/print?doc=Report

GET /solid/isp/scan
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DIP — Dependency Inversion

Idea: high-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete classes.
The example: OrderService depends on OrderRepo (interface). InMemoryOrderRepo is one implementation; you could swap to a JPA repo without touching the service/controller.
Run:

GET /solid/dip/create?name=Milk

GET /solid/dip/all

All examples live under com.example.demo.solid.{srp|ocp|lsp|isp|dip}.
